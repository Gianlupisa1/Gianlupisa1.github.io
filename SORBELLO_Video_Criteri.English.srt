00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:07,379
I have covered the Success Criterion 1.4.2 on Audio Control and

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,320
the Success Criterion 1.4.7 on the Sound Background. These two criteria have one element in common

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,029
that is the sound. Speaking of the success criterion 1.4.2

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,230
I wanted to illustrate ways to improve accessibility

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,460
of your site which includes a video

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:41,540
I was therefore able to illustrate how the movie can be controlled

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,770
by the user how this accessibility option can be added

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:57,140
and also how to have the sounds reproduced only at the request of the user

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,250
by controlling the movie I mean the possibility for the user

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:17,890
to be able to freeze the movie, go forward, go back, pause or otherwise

11
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,979
have all possible controls for that video like putting it in full screen or

12
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,390
still check the audio.

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:36,140
To do this I added in my html code in the part concerning the

14
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:48,370
video so where there is also the source of the video, I added the word "Controls". This wording allows

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:56,600
to show a bar that is

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,400
this bar that practically allows you to go forward in the video,

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,800
go back, be able to fully control it, be able to edit the audio

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,890
being able to reduce or increase it and be able to restart it at any point

19
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,510
and of course full screen mode

20
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,040
Speaking instead of the reproduction of sounds only on request

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,790
of the user, even here it was enough to enter the same wording

22
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,910
or "Controls" as I have shown before in fact it can I can through

23
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:42,200
this slider I will be able to decrease, increase the volume and of course

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:51,880
block it then start the video without any audio and then start it again later.

25
00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:05,500
I also added the possibility of starting the video together with the changed default site by means of the wording "Mood"

26
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:12,709
so that if the user does not expect a site with a video that

27
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,380
starts by itself at full volume, obviously it starts changed and then if

28
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,380
want can restart the audio or not.

29
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,799
Speaking instead of the success criterion 1.4.7 on the sound background,

30
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,709
this is a criterion that should be able to guarantee

31
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:42,960
to every user, even those who unfortunately have hearing problems can

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:53,820
be able to distinguish what concerns vocal speech,

33
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:01,310
the vocal sound that is present in the video and can distinguish it separate it from others

34
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:10,060
other types of background speech content external to speech content.

35
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,760
The technique I am now explaining is the G56

36
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:26,240
that is the technique to verify that this happens to be

37
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,440
sure there is a good distinction between the two

38
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,860
sound contents must be checked by measuring the decibels of the volume

39
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,040
of the video then the procedure is this: first you need to measure

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,420
the total decibels of the video or during a time when the video plays both

41
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,990
the content of the voice is the content of the sound background and therefore as I say

42
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,970
here the total volume then must subsequently be measured

43
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,880
always via a decibel meter that I don't have now

44
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,860
or via a meter via mobile application can be

45
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,850
verified this thing and then measure the partial volume or

46
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,360
only the sound background. After doing this this measurement is enough

47
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,760
subtract the partial volume from the total volume in order to find

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,820
only the volume applied to the voice. If this result

49
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,540
is equal to or greater than 20 decibels then criterion 1.4.7 can

50
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:52,030
be considered satisfied

51
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:59,140
therefore the site is also accessible to a user with hearing problems.

52
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,010
The other possible solution as it is also written in the document is that of

53
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:11,390
completely eliminate the sound background or start the video only

54
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,450
with the voice in the sense of not inserting any background sound content.

55
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,480
I hope I was clear, hello everyone!
